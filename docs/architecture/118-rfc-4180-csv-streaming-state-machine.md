# Architecture Note 118: RFC 4180 CSV Streaming State Machine

## Overview
State machine parser and emitter enforcing strict quotation rules, embedded CRLF preservation, and Excel-compatible UTF-8 BOM injection for CSV export targets.

## Key Principles
1. Enforce strict bounded memory and zero-copy streaming throughout pipeline execution.
2. Maintain decoupled hexagonal boundaries between core domain logic and external I/O adapters.
3. Implement deterministic state machines for error handling, backpressure, and lifecycle transitions.
4. Ensure full cross-platform compatibility across Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android runtimes.

## Architectural Guarantees
- Constant O(1) memory overhead regardless of playlist size or track count.
- Fail-safe recovery from unexpected process termination with zero corrupted artifacts.
