# Architecture Note 109: LRU Eviction Policy for Album Artwork and Metadata Cache

## Overview
Bounded in-memory Least Recently Used cache holding normalized artist and album metadata across paginated imports to prevent repetitive network lookups for common artists.

## Key Principles
1. Enforce strict bounded memory and zero-copy streaming throughout pipeline execution.
2. Maintain decoupled hexagonal boundaries between core domain logic and external I/O adapters.
3. Implement deterministic state machines for error handling, backpressure, and lifecycle transitions.
4. Ensure full cross-platform compatibility across Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android runtimes.

## Architectural Guarantees
- Constant O(1) memory overhead regardless of playlist size or track count.
- Fail-safe recovery from unexpected process termination with zero corrupted artifacts.
